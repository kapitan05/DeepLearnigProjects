In the project Siamese neural network was used using TensorFlow and Keras. 
Binary cross-entropy loss, Adam optimizer, and custom layers like L1Dist to measure the distance between
image embeddings. The data augmented with resizing, normalization, and shuffling.
OpenCV is for webcam integration. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using recall and 
precision metrics.
