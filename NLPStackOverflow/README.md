This project was done in a team with Yahor and Oleksij. My main part was focused on exploring 
the correlation between mentioning weather-related phrases in Travel Stack Exchange posts and the actual 
weather conditions at the userâ€™s location when the post was created.
I used different text preprocessing techniques, like lemmatization, removing stop words, exploring 2- and 3-grams, 
and extracting topic-related phrases. I also tried using PCA to cluster the posts. The results were visualized.
