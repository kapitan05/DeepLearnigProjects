The Simpson project is about Simpsons classification using PyTorch.
In the project, I used augmentation techniques (rotations, cropping, resizing, flipping).
The DataLoader was used for loading data with batching and shuffling.
A model training pipeline was created to efficiently update the best model weights.
The project isnâ€™t finished and still needs modifications.
(A pre-trained ResNet18 model could be used for fine tuning)
